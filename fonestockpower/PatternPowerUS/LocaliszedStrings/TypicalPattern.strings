"Big Bull" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Big White Candle</strong><br/>The price rose significantly during the session to close above the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font>. The result is a candle with a long green body. You can edit the range of the candlestick and create your own patterns using DIY Pattern.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates that buyers were aggressive during the session. A Big Bull with an opening price lower than yesterday’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> can mark a support level. A Big Bull with an <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> higher than the previous <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> shows strong buy pressure. After a long downtrend, a Big Bull can be a sign that a bottom has formed and a trend reversal is at hand. The trend reversal can be further confirmed by increased volume. This would be considered a good time to buy.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>When preceded by a long uptrend with decreasing volume, the Big Bull can mark the end of a topping process. In that case, you might want to sell or even to short before the price declines.";


"Three Bulls" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Three White Soldiers</strong><br/>Three consecutive green candles with ascending highs and ascending lows.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern suggests that buyers are aggressive, and that the price is likely to rise significantly. After a long flat-trend, Three Bulls can mark the beginning of an uptrend. Likewise, Three Bulls after a long downtrend, or after a Morning Star, indicates that a bottom has formed, and therefore a good opportunity to buy.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>See if the rise in price is confirmed by increased volume. Small cap stocks and other stocks that are prone to manipulation should be handled with care. If the Three Bulls have already pushed the price too high, a drop may occur soon, especially after a long uptrend.";

"Long Horns" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>For two consecutive days, the price declined at some point during the session then rose up to close significantly above the low, resulting in two hammers—or two green candles with small bodies and short or no upper shadows. The more recent <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> is higher than its previous <font color=#008cd6>Close</font>. The pattern looks like a pair of horns pointing down ready to attack.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The long lower shadow suggests that sellers were active at some point during the session, but the strong finish shows that towards the end of the session buyers were regaining control. Two rising hammers can therefore signal a bullish revival. After a significant drop in price, Long Horns can indicate that the bottoming process has ended and a reversal will soon take place. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>See if the reversal signal is confirmed by increased volume. The higher the volume, the more likely that buyers will drive the price up.";


"Morning Star" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Morning Doji Star</strong><br/>The pattern consists of a downtrend, followed by a long bearish candle, a cross or doji that gaps down, and a long bullish candle that gaps up and closes above the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> of the preceding bearish candle.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The downtrend and the long bearish candle show that sellers have been in control until the occurrence of the cross, which reflects indecision in the market. The long green candle that follows then signals that buyers are regaining control and a reversal is pending.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>The pattern does not occur often. But when it does, it is often a reliable signal of reversal. Still, further confirmation is needed to avoid false breakthrough. If the Big Bull or Three Bulls occurs after the Morning Star, it is usually a good time to establish long positions.";

"Bull Hug" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>The pattern consists of a long green candle, a small red candle in harami position, followed by another long green candle engulfing it.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>Bull Hug occurs when some buyers try to shake off followers by creating a drop in price, which is then quickly pushed back up by the market. It may also occur when the market is still bearish but the buy pressure is also strong. It often indicates a strong uptrend.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>See if heavyweight buyers have started to sell as the price begins to rise.";

"Bull & 3 Cubs" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After three days of decline, the stock opened at a new low, then rose significantly to close above the highs of the three red candles preceding it.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>Buyers regained control and turned the trend upward. The price is likely to continue rising, especially when the volume of the big green candle is about the sum of the three reds.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If the volume is not high enough, the rise in price may just be a technical bounce. A technical bounce is a short-term, limited upward movement that occurs after a price drop when the company fundamentals and market sentiment remain unchanged. Like a deflated ball bouncing back up and lower after each fall, the price is most likely to fall again soon after a technical bounce.";

"Long Island" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>The pattern consists of a downtrend, followed by a bearish or bullish candle that gaps down, and a bullish candle that gaps up. The pattern looks like a bull island in a bear sea.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The gap is often the result of important news announcements between sessions, or heavyweight investors attempting to drive the market towards the direction they want. A gap up followed by a candle with a low higher than the previous high is called a bullish gap. And a gap down followed by a candle with a high lower than the previous low is called a bearish gap. A bear gap followed immediately by a bull gap is a strong reversal signal, often followed by at least one brief uptrend. As long as the price does not go below the bull gap, staying on the buy side should be a good idea.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Though unlikely, if the price drops below the bull gap, it may be time to sell. ";

"Breakthrough" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>A Big Bull occurs after a long flat-trend.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates that sell pressure has weakened. It may be the beginning of a bullish run, and therefore a good time to consider establishing long positions.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Be careful with false reversal signals. A false breakthrough will only have one Big Bull, after which the price will quickly drop to or below the low of the Big Bull.";


"Long Shadow Bottom" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After a downtrend, the stock opened lower than the previous <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> and went further down during the session, hitting a new low, then rose up to close at or near the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font>.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>A technical bounce may soon follow, which can offer a good opportunity for day trading. If not, a Long Shadow Bottom followed by another hammer marks a newly formed bottom, which can also be a good buying opportunity.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If the volume is not high enough, there can only be limited bounce.</font>";


"Bull Brewing" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After a Big Bull, there is a period of relatively flat movement in which none of the candles dropped below the midpoint of the Big Bull.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates that the price will rise again soon, especially if the volume decreases after the Big Bull.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If there is high volume after the Big Bull, then the direction is not as certain.</font>";

"Cub Stand Up" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After multiple days of uptrend in which the price reached a few new highs, the price gapped up and dropped slightly but remained higher than the highs of the previous days. The body of the red candle is smaller than that of the green candle preceding it. The pattern looks like a small cub standing up to fight.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>Despite signs of increased sell pressure, buy pressure remains strong. The uptrend is still likely to continue after the slight drop in price. The red candle can suggest that some buyers are taking profit. Coupled with low volume, a bearish reversal is unlikely to happen soon.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If the price has reached a relatively high level with high volume, it can be a sign that many buyers are taking profit. In that case, the uptrend might not hold. </font>";

"Bull Escape" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After a downtrend, the price dropped even lower, then rose for two consecutive days. The second green candle’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> is above the high of the red candle before it.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>It indicates that the downward pressure has diminished, and that the buy side is regaining control. Coupled with increased volume, the Bull Escape is usually a strong reversal sign.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>It may not be a solid reversal sign if the volume of the green candles is smaller than the red one.";

"Big Bear" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Big Black Candle</strong><br/>The candle has a large red body, suggesting that the price dropped significantly during the session to close at a level much lower than it opened. You can define the shape and length of your own candlestick using <strong>DIY Pattern</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The Big Bear indicates that the sell pressure is much stronger than the buy pressure. If the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> is above yesterday’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font>, the Big Bear indicates that buyers have begun selling or losing confidence. If the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> is lower than yesterday’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font>, the Big Bear implies strong sell pressure. If the Big Bear occurs in a long uptrend with high volume, a top may be forming. It could be a good time to sell or short.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>After a long downtrend with reduced volume, the Big Bear can be a sign of a bottom. In that case, you might want to establish long positions.";

"Three Bears" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Three Black Crows</strong><br/>Three red candles with descending lows and descending highs. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates that sellers were aggressive. After a long flat-trend, Three Bears can mark a good time to sell. After a long uptrend, Three Bears can signal the beginning of a downtrend, and an even better time to sell. On the other hand, Three Bears after an Evening Star confirms that a top has formed.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Watch out for technical bounces, which are limited upward movements in stock prices, occurring briefly when company fundamentals and market sentiment remain unchanged.";


"Bear Teeth" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>Two descending inverted hammers with little or no lower shadows. The second hammer’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> is lower than the previous <font color=#008cd6>Close</font>. The pattern looks like the teeth of a roaring bear.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>A Tooth or inverted hammer suggests that the price was driven up during the day to a high, and then brought down significantly to close at or near low. Two descending teeth indicate strong sell pressure at this price level. After a long uptrend with increased volume, the Bear Teeth often signal a top, and therefore the beginning of a downtrend.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>The top can be further confirmed when the Bear Teeth is followed by a technical bounce which does not surpass the highs of the teeth.";

"Evening Star" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Evening Doji Star</strong><br/>The pattern consists of an uptrend, followed by a long bullish candle, a cross or doji that gaps up, and a long bearish candle that gaps down. The <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> of the red candle is lower than the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> of the green candlestick. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The cross indicates indecision in the market, as buy and sell pressure become equally strong. The market is active but unsure of which way to go. The long red candle that follows then marks a potential trend reversal. However, if the uptrend continues, it can be a sign of topping.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Evening Star is rarely seen. But when seen, it is often a good signal to sell. However, further confirmation is advised if you want to short. Evening Star followed by a Big Bear or Three Bears is a more reliable signal to short.";

"Bear Hug" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>The pattern consists of a long red candle, a small green candle in harami position, and another long red candle engulfing it.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The Bear Hug often confirms a downtrend. The small green candle indicates that buyers were active after yesterday’s bearish market, but the long bearish candle that occurs after the green candle shows that sellers were still aggressive. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>See if heavyweight sellers have stopped shorting as an early sign of reversal.";

"Bear & 3 Calves" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>The pattern consists of three bullish candles and a much larger bearish candle engulfing them. The red candle’s <font color=#008cd6>Close</font> is below the lows of the green candles.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>After an uptrend, sellers became aggressive and brought the price down to a new low. This can be a sign of potential trend reversal, and may be further confirmed by increased volume, especially when the volume of the long red candle is about the sum of the three green ones. Given enough volume, the high of the long red candlestick will be hard to overcome. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If, after the Bear & Three Calves, a rebound takes place and the price surpasses the high of the red candle, it can be a sign that buyers have regained control.";

"Bear Island" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>After an uptrend, a gap up is followed by a gap down. It is like a bear island in a bull sea.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>Gaps are usually caused by important news announcements between sessions, or heavyweight investors trying to drive the market to certain directions. A bullish gap is a gap up followed by candle with a low higher than the previous day’s high. A bearish gap is a gap down followed by a candle with a high lower than the previous day’s low. A bullish gap followed immediately by a bearish gap is a strong reversal signal. It is often followed by a downtrend. As long as the price does not go above the bearish gap, you can consider staying on the sell side or shorting.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Though unlikely, if the price goes above the bearish gap, it may be time to buy. ";

"Tumble Down" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>A Big Bear occurs after a long flat-trend.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates weak buy pressure and possibly the beginning of a bearish run. It may be time to sell or short. The original support level can now become a resistance level.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Be careful with false reversal signals. After a false reversal signal, there will not be more Big Bears. </font>";

"Long Spike Top" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>Following an uptrend, the stock opened even higher than the previous <font color=#008cd6>Close</font>, hitting a new high before dropping down to close at or near the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font>. <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern often occurs when buyers run out of steam or begin to take profit. If the next day sees another inverted hammer, it should be a strong sign of a top.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>Once a reversal takes place, the downtrend should be a strong one, unless the volume diminishes significantly. </font>";

"Bear Brewing" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>A Big Bear followed by a period of relatively flat movement, in which none of the candles went above the midpoint of the Big Bear.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>It indicates that the price should soon drop significantly, especially if the volume reduces after the Big Bull.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If there is high volume immediately after the Big Bull, then the direction is not as certain.";

"Calf Stand Up" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/><strong>a.k.a Evening Doji Star</strong><br/>After a downtrend, the price gapped down at <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> and rose slightly to close below the candles before it. The pattern looks like a small calf standing up to fight.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The small bullish candle shows weak buy pressure, and should not be regarded as a reversal sign, especially if the volume is low. It is best not to become a big buyer immediately. The downtrend will most likely continue.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>If the volume is high, watch out for a bounce. In that case, despite the small price change and active buy side, the downtrend may not hold.";

"Bear Invade" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>Definition:</strong></font><br/>The pattern consists of an uptrend, followed by a long bullish candle and two smaller bearish candles. Following the uptrend, the price reached a new high, but soon dropped for two consecutive days, in which the second bearish candle closed below the <font color=#008cd6>Open</font> of the long bullish candle.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Implication:</strong></font><br/>The pattern indicates that the price may start to crumble as sellers regain control. Bear Invade coupled with high volume can be a strong reversal sign confirming that a top has formed.<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>Reminder:</strong></font><br/>It cannot a solid reversal sign if the volume of the red candles is smaller than that of the green candle. If the price bounces back up soon after a Bear Invade, the price should drop again significantly as long as the high of the green candle has not been surpassed.";


"Big Bull_6" = "Definition:\nThe candle has a large green body.  The price goes up after the market Opens, and closes much higher than it opened.  You can define your own size in DIY Pattern.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe intraday buying power is much stronger than the selling power.  If Open is lower than yesterday’s Close, Big Bull indicates the price is acceptable to many at this level.  If Open is higher than the previous Close, Big Bull indicates a strong buy.  If Big Bull is in a long downtrend with high volume, it might be the beginning of a bottom.  This would be considered a good time to buy.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf Big Bull is in a long uptrend with decreasing volume, it might be a sign of topping.  Watch out for subsequent development.  You might want to sell or even to short.";

"Three Bulls_6" = "Definition:\nThree consecutive green candles, with each High higher than the previous High, and Low also higher than the previous Low.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often a strong attack signal from the buy side in the uptrend.  If it happens after a long flat-trend, it is a good sign to buy.  If it happens after a long downtrend, the buying signal is even stronger, and could be a bottoming sign.  If it happens after a Morning Star, there a high probability that a bottom has formed.\n\n\nReminder:\nSee if the volume goes up as well.  Watch out for small cap or light traffic stocks, they could be manipulated.  If the three bulls have already pushed the price too high, then there may not be margin left.  If three bulls happen after a long uptrend, it may be the last run, watch for subsequent development.";

"Long Horns_6" = "Definition:\nTwo consecutive days having long lower shadows, Close at or near High and higher than Open, and today’s Close is higher than yesterday’s Close.  It is like two horns pointing down ready to hook.\n\n\nImplication:\nA long lower shadow means Close is much higher than Low.  A Long Horn or Hammer means the price was driven down during the day to a Low, but brought back up much higher, and Close at High.  Two long horns with one bigger than the other indicate a strong support at this price level.  If it happens in a long downtrend with high volume, it could be a strong sign of bottoming.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch the intraday volume.  If the volume increases when the price goes up, then it is a strong buy.  If the volume appears at Low then it is not a sharp horn.";

"Morning Star_6" = "Definition:\nIn the downtrend the price was driven down further by a red candle, followed by a gap down and ended with a cross, but then jumps back up high with a long green candle.  The green candle’s Close is higher than the red candle’s Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nA cross happens when someone sells it to a Low and others buy it to a High but Close at Open.  It means the market is active but unsure which way to go.  The movement of the next day often provides the clue for the direction.  Morning Star appears in a downtrend.  If the downtrend is persistent, it is often a good sign of bottoming.\n\n\nReminder:\nMorning Star does not happen often.  When it does, it is often a good signal to buy.  But do not put all your money on one sign, and watch out for fake breakthrough. You might want to increase your long position, if it is followed by Big Bull or Three Bulls.";

"Bull Hug_6" = "Definition:\nOne small red candle hugged by two green candles with larger bodies.  The High and Low of the red candle are within the bodies of the green candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt happens when some buying parties try to shake the followers by faking a down turn, but are quickly pushed back up by the market.  It may also happen when people are still bearish, but the buying power is strong.  It often indicates the uptrend is strong.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch if heavy weight buyers starting to sell in the uptrend.";

"Bull & 3 Cubs_6" = "Definition:\nOne big bull beats three bear cubs.  After three days of decline, it opens low again, but then rises strongly to a High, and closes higher than the High of the three red candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe buying power regains control and turns the trend upward, especially when the volume of the big green is about the sum of the three reds.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is not big enough, it could be just a technical bounce.  That means the fundamental of the company or sentiment of the market has not changed, the bounce back is just from the falling of the price, like a deflated ball bouncing back when falling from a high place, and is most likely to fall again.";

"Long Island_6" = "Definition:\nIn the downtrend, a gap down followed by a gap up. It is like a bull island in the bear sea.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe gap is often caused by certain news after a previous session is closed, or driven by heavy weight buyers or sellers to the direction they want. A bull gap is a gap up and a green candle, with today’s Low higher than yesterday’s High.  A bear gap is a gap down and a red candle, with today’s High lower than yesterday’s Low.  A bear gap followed immediately by a bull gap is a strong reversal signal.  It is often followed by at least a brief uptrend.  As long as the price does not go back below the bull gap, you can consider staying on the buy side.\n\n\nReminder:\nThough unlikely, if the price drops back below the bull gap, it may be time to sell.";

"Breakthrough_6" = "Definition:\nA big bull appears after a long flat-trend.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the selling pressure has been digested.  It may be the beginning of a bullish run.  It is time to consider long position.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch subsequent development carefully, it may be a fake breakthrough with just one big bull.  A fake signal is when it falls back down quickly and back to or below the Low of the big bull.";

"Long Shadow Bottom_6" = "Definition:\nA long lower shadow in the downtrend, opens lower than yesterday’s Close, and the price keeps going down to the lowest Low on the current downtrend, but the price goes up sharply and Close at or near Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt could be followed by a technical bounce with just one long lower-shadow.  If it is followed by another long lower shadow and forms long horns, then it becomes a strong sign of a bottom.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is not substantiated, the bounce will be limited.";

"Bull Brewing_6" = "Definition:\nA big bull follows by three small rises or falls, but none of the three days Low falls below the mid point of the big bull\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the resting of the buy side, but the bull may be ready to attack again.  If the volume reduced during the three days rest, the following attack may be stronger.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there are high volumes in the three days, then the direction is not as certain.";

"Cub Stand Up_6" = "Definition:\nA gap up in the uptrend, opens with a gap up but Closes lower than it opened, and the body of the red candle is smaller than the bodies of the previous two green candles.  It is like a small cub stands up to fight.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt is too weak to be a reversal sign.  It often happens when some buyers are taking profit.  If the volume is low, the cub can not reverse the trend, and the uptrend continues.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is high, even though the price change is small, and there are many buyers profit taking at this level, then the uptrend may not hold.";

"Bull Escape_6" = "Definition:\nA large red candle hit a recent low in a downtrend, but followed by two green candles, one smaller than the other.   The larger green candle tops the large red candle with its Close higher than the High of the red candle.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the downward pressure has been stopped, and the buy side has the upper hand.  The stopping sign is valid if the volume is high.  If the volume is very high it could be a reversal sign.\n\n\nReminder:\nIt may not be a solid sign if the volume is smaller than the red.";

"Big Bear_6" = "Definition:\nThe candle has a large red body.  The price goes down after opening, and Closes much lower than it opened.  You can define your own size in DIY Pattern.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe intraday selling power is much stronger than the buying power.  If Open is higher than yesterday’s Close, Big Bear indicates the buy side has started profit taking or losing confidence.  If Open is lower than yesterday’s Close, Big Bear indicates a strong sell.  If Big Bear happens in a long uptrend with high volume, it might be a top forming.  It could be a good time to sell, or time to short.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf Big Bear happens in a long downtrend with reduced volume, it might be the sign of a bottom.  Watch out for subsequent development.  You might want to establish a long position.";

"Three Bears_6" = "Definition:\nThree consecutive red candles, with each Low lower than the previous Low, and High also lower than the previous High.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often a strong attack signal from the sell side in the downtrend.  If it happens after a long flat-trend, it is a good sign to sell.  If it happens after a long uptrend, the selling signal is even stronger, and could be a top sign.  If it happens after an Evening Star, it often confirms a top has formed.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch out for technical bounce.  That means the fundamental of the company or sentiment of the market has not changed, the bounce back is just from the falling of the price, like a deflated ball bouncing back when falling from a high place, and is most likely to fall again.";

"Bear Teeth_6" = "Definition:\nTwo consecutive days having long upper shadows, Close at or near Low and lower than Open, and today’s Close is lower than the yesterday’s Close.  It is like a bear roaring with two teeth pointing up.\n\n\nImplication:\nA long upper shadow means Close is much lower than High.  A Tooth or Inverted Hammer means the price was driven up during the day to a High, but brought back down much lower, and Closed at Low.  Two teeth with one bigger than the other Indicates a strong selling pressure at this price level.  If it happens in a long uptrend and comes with high volume, it could be a strong sign of topping.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there is a technical bounce in the subsequent development, but the bounce fails to reach the High of the teeth, then it could be a confirmation of a top.";

"Evening Star_6" = "Definition:\nIn the uptrend the price was driven up further by a green candle, followed by a gap up ended with a cross, but then jumped back down low with a long red candle, and the red candle’s Close is lower than the green candle’s Open .\n\n\nImplication:\nA cross happens when someone sells it to a Low and others buy it to a High but Close at Open.  It means the market is active but unsure which way to go.  The movement of the next day often provides the clue for the direction.  Evening Star appears in an uptrend.  If the uptrend is persistent, it is often a good sign of topping.\n\n\nReminder:\nEvening Star does not happen often.  When it does, it is often a good sign to sell.  But if you want to short, it is better to look for more confirmations like Big Bear or Three Bears in the following development.  Do not put all your money on one sign.";

"Bear Hug_6" = "Definition:\nOne small green candle hugged by two red candles with larger bodies.  The High and Low of the green candle are within the bodies of the red candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt often happens when buy side tries to rebound but fails, and results in a heavier sell.  It often confirms a downtrend.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch if heavy weight sellers stop their shorts as an early sign of reversal.";

"Bear & 3 Calves_6" = "Definition:\nOne big bear engulfs three calves.  After three days’ ups, it opens high again, but then falls sharply to a Low, and closes lower than the Low of the three green candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe selling power regains control and turns the trend downward, especially when the volume of the big red is about the sum of the three greens.  The subsequent rebound is hard to overcome the High of this bear, if the volume of the bear is really large.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf subsequent rebound overcomes the High with volume, then the buy side takes control again.";

"Bear Island_6" = "Definition:\nIn the uptrend, a gap up is followed by a gap down. It is like a bear island in the bull sea.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe gap is often caused by certain news after a previous session is closed, or driven by heavy weight buyers or sellers to the direction they want. A bull gap is a gap up and a green candle, with today’s Low higher than yesterday’s High.  A bear gap is a gap down and a red candle, with today’s High lower than yesterday’s Low.  A bull gap followed immediately by a bear gap is a strong reversal signal.  It is often followed by a downtrend.  As long as the price does not go back above the bear gap, you can consider staying on the sell side or shorting.\n\n\nReminder:\nThough unlikely, if the price pulls back up the bear gap, it may be time to buy.";

"Tumble Down_6" = "Definition:\nA big bear appears after a long flat-trend.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the buying power has lost steam.  It may be the beginning of a bearish run.  It may be time to sell or consider shorting.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch subsequent developments carefully, it may be a fake tumble down with just one big bear.";

"Long Spike Top_6" = "Definition:\nA long upper shadow in the uptrend, Open higher than yesterday’s Close, and the price keeps going up to the highest High on the current uptrend, but the price goes down sharply and Close at or near Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often the case when the buy side runs out of stream or ready to take profit.  If it is followed by another long up shadow and forms a Bear Teeth, then it becomes a strong sign of a top.\n\n\nReminder:\nIn the downtrend, to reverse the trend, the volume often has to reduce to a very small amount.  So, once the trend turns here and there’s bounce back, look at the volume.";

"Bear Brewing_6" = "Definition:\nA big bear followed by three small rises or falls, but none of the three days’ High went above the mid point of the big bear.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the resting of the sell side, but the bear may be ready to attack again.  If the volume reduces during the three days rest, the following attack may be stronger.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there are high volumes in the three days, then the direction is not as certain.";

"Calf Stand Up_6" = "Definition:\nA gap down in the downtrend, opens with a gap down but closes higher than it opened, and the body of the green candle is smaller than the bodies of the previous two red candles.  It is like a small calf stands up to fight.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt is too weak to be a reversal sign.  Do not become a big buyer immediately.  If the volume is low, the calf can not reverse the trend, and the downtrend continues.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is high watch out for a bounce.  If the volume is very high, even though the price change is small, and the buyers become active, the downtrend may not hold.  In this case watch out for small cap manipulation.";

"Bear Invade_6" = "Definition:\nA large green candle hit a recent high in an uptrend, but followed by two red candles, one smaller than the other, the larger red candle enters the railing of the bulls, with its Close lower than the Low of the green candle.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the price may start to crumble, and the sell side has the upper hand.  If the volume is very high it could be a reversal sign and a top is shaped.\n\n\nReminder:\nIt is not a solid sign if the volume is smaller than the green candle.  If it bounces back later but the High does not reach the High of the green candle, it may fall back down harder.";
