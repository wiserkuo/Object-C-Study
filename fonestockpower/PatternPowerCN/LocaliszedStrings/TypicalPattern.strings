"大阳线" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 今日的走势开盘以后往上走，而且收盘价大于开盘价相当大的幅度。你可以在”我的图示”中，自行订定幅度大小。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表今日的买气大于卖压。如果开盘价低于昨天收盘价表示低档有人承接，如果开盘价高于昨天收盘价表示有人继续追价。如果股价已经下跌一段时间，则这个信号就有可能是落底反弹的转折机会。若成交量同时增加，则股价转强的机会更大。这个时候可能是底部信号，或是续强信号，可考虑买进。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/>如果股价已经涨了一大段后出现长红棒，反而可能为涨势末端。若成交量缩小，将可能出现回跌走势。这个时候反而可能是头部信号，该考虑卖出。</font>";

"红三兵" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 连续三天出现开低走高的红K棒，而且每天的高点都比前一天高，而且每天的低点也比前一天的低点高。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/>这样的走势常为多方强势攻击的形态，股价将有机会大幅上扬，尤其在主升段的点位，更可追价买进。如果在股价已经跌了一大段后出现，则常常是底部信号，股价从此由空翻多。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 需留意成交量是否同步放大。另外小型股容易为人为炒作，需留意资金流向。如果股价已经上涨很多，也许是最后一波，要注意后续发展。 </font>";

"锤头线" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 连续二天都收长下影线，并且收盘都收在最高点或接近最高点，而且第二天高点比第一天高。这个形状就像牛角向下准备攻击。<br/><br/><br/><font color=' red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 长下影线为收盘价大幅高于最低价的走势，表示盘中股价被卖盘打落后，低档有买盘进场承接，显示多方的力道强势，后续将有机会形成弹升格局。两支铁锤，而且一支比另一支高，股价确立向上的机会非常高。如果在股价已经跌了一大段后出现，则常常是底部信号，股价从此由空翻多。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 必须同时注意当日量能走势，如果盘中上拉的过程中量能同时增加，将有利后续的买气推升。</font>";

"早晨十字星" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 经过一段的下跌走势后，出现长黑K棒的重挫走势，接续隔天向下跳空，不过收盘收十字线，随后最近一个交易日再跳空向上，并且拉出一根长红K棒，而且长红K棒的收盘价突破长黑K棒的起跌点。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 十字线代表盘中有人拉高有人杀低，所以留上、下影线，但是收盘价等于开盘价，表示多空势力均等，或不确定要往哪一个方向。晨星十字出现则代表多空趋势开始易位，买盘的力量已反转越过先前的下跌压力，买方开始主导后续走势。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 这种形态不常出现，但如果出现这样形态，常常为强烈之向上变盘信号。可以尽早布局。然仍须观察后势，预防假突破。后续如有大牛或三牛出现则可适度追加。</font>";

"两阳夹一阴" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在二根长红K棒的走势中，夹带了一根弱势的小黑K，而且黑K棒的高低点都被包夹在二根红K棒的实体中，形成像是夹心饼的状况。<br/><br/><br/><font color= 'red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表股价在拉高压低后，又重新发动，通常为特定买盘刻意的作价买卖形态，可以考虑跟进。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 需留意特定筹码状况，股价上涨的过程中，特定买盘的筹码是否开始出脱。</font>";

"看漲吞沒" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在连续三天黑K后，以低盘开出，然后出现大涨格局，并且收盘价一举越过前三日黑K高点，形成一根红K棒覆盖过三天黑K棒的吞噬状况。<br/><br/><br/><font color= 'red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表多方重拾控盘的主导权，后续走势将有机会转强。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 红K棒的量能如果不够大的话，可能仅是技术性反弹。技术性反弹时，股票本质没有改变，反弹只是像泄气的皮球掉到地上也会弹回来，并且愈弹愈低。如果后续股价回落并跌破红K棒的收盘价，走势将再转弱。 </font>";

"多方孤島" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在下跌趋势中，出现空方缺口后，紧接着出现多方缺口，此多方缺口直接跳过空方缺口，让K线形态形成一个类似孤岛的形状。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 缺口的形成通常是因为前一天收盘后有重大消息，或是有特定大型买家或卖家介入，造成隔天股价开盘跳空不连续的状况。多方缺口为今天的最低价高于前一天最高价；空方缺口则为今天的最高价低于前一天最低价的状况。先跳空，再跳多，这样的形态通常是一个强势扭转趋势的机会。至少是一个抢短信号，只要回跌不补多方缺口，都可考虑站在买方。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 如后续回跌，并且跌破多方缺口，则可考虑站在卖方。</font>";

"横盘突破" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 股价经过一段时间的横向整理后，出现突破而且创近期高点的关键长红K棒。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表过去整理区间的潜在卖压已消化完毕，这时将会吸引追价买盘开始进入，将有机会成为波段起涨点。<br/><br/><br/><font color=' red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 需注意是否出现假突破(后续快速跌回到横盘整理区间) 的骗线可能。</font>";

"下影探底" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 下跌趋势中，股价开盘比前日收盘低，而且盘中更创下近日的最低点，但收盘前反向拉升，留下一条长下影线。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 这线型将有机会出现利空出尽后的技术性反弹走势，可以留意短线的弹升机会。在下跌趋势中，如果隔天又是一个长下影线，就形成类似双锤打桩的形态，底部信号将更加明确。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 弹升过程中，如果量能无法放大，反弹的趋势力量将容易受限。</font>";

"上升三法" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在一根长红拉升大涨后，连续三日都出现小涨小跌的整理走势，而且每日的低点都没有跌破红K棒的中线位置。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 这可视为在一段涨势中的中继整理形态，股价将有随时酝酿再攻的机会。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 整理过程中如果出现量缩的状况会更好，后续再攻的力道将会一次爆发。</font>";

"空头抵抗" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 上升趋势中，股价开盘持续创高，但收盘小幅跌落，并出现小黑K的走势，不过今日的低点还比昨日的高点高，而且今日的黑K实体线比前二日的红K实体线短。<br/><br/><br/> <font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 显示虽出现卖压，但力道不重，股价小幅受挫后，仍有机会维持强势格局，不要恐慌卖出，仍可以续抱观察。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 虽然今日价格变化不大，但如果股价在高档出现这样形态，并且出现成交量放大，表示低档买进之筹码可能开始获利了结。</font>";

"阳线脱困" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 下跌趋势中，股价出现黑K破底的空头走势，但随后连续二天出现红K棒，而且最近一个交易日的收盘价已越过黑K棒的高点。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'> <strong>意涵: </strong></font><br/> 表示股价的破底危机已有效化解，多方买盘重新掌握局势。若​​能同时搭配量能提升，则扭转态势的力道将更为强烈。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 如果红K棒的量低于黑K棒则须小心观察后势，但仍是可注意的标的。</font>";

"大阴线" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 今日的走势开盘以后往下走，而且收盘价低于开盘价相当大的幅度。你可以在”我的图示”中，自行订定幅度大小。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 表示卖方的压力远大于买方的支撑力，如果开盘价高于昨天的收盘价，表示买盘开始松动。如果开盘价低于昨天的收盘价，而且成交量很大表示恐慌性杀盘，如果股价处于高档区，要密切提防起跌的可能，积极者可考虑反手放空。<br/><br/><br/><font color ='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 若已在下降趋势中，如果出现明显的滞息量，反而有机会形成卖压竭尽后的反弹走势。 </font>";

"三只乌鸦" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 连续三天出现开高走低的黑K棒，而且每天的低点都比前一天低，高点也比前一天的高点低。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 这样的走势象征空方急跌的弱势形态，股价将不容易出现涨势，若在主跌段的部位出现，将可追空卖出。如果在股价已经涨了一大段之后出现，则常常是头部信号，股价从此由多翻空。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 短线需注意跌深后的多方技术性反弹。技术性反弹指的是股票本质没有改变，反弹只是像泄气的皮球掉到地上弹回来，并且愈弹愈低。如果后续股价回落，空头走势更加确立。</font>";

"倒锤头线" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 连续二天都出现长上影线，而且收盘都收在最低点，而且第二天比第一天更低。这个形状就像大熊露出双牙准备攻击。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'> <strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 长上影线为收盘价大幅低于最高价的走势，表示盘中股价被买盘拉高后，被卖盘往下打，显示空方的力道强势，后续将可能继续下杀。两支反向铁锤，而且一支比另一支低，股价确立向下的机会非常高。如果在股价已经上升了一大段后出现，则常常是头部信号，股价从此由多翻空。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 后续如未能反弹越过高点，将容易形成套牢的做头走势。</font>";

"黄昏十字星" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在一段的上涨趋势中，出现长红K棒的拉升走势，接续隔天向上跳空，但​​​​​​留下十字线没有收高，随后最近一个交易日跳空向下收一根长黑K棒，同时长黑K棒的收盘价跌破长红K棒的起涨点。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 十字线代表盘中有人拉高有人杀低，所以留上、下影线，但是收盘价等于开盘价，表示多空势力均等，或不确定要往哪个方向。夜星十字出现则代表多空趋势开始易位，卖盘的力量已翻转越过先前的上涨力量，卖方开始主导后续走势。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</ strong></font><br/> 这种形态不常出现，但如果出现这样形态，常常为强列之变盘向下信号。可提早卖出或反手作空，但是要注意后续发展，也不要把所有钱压在一个信号。</font>";

"两阴夹一阳" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在二根长黑棒的走势中，夹带了一根反弹的小红K，而且红K棒的高低点都被包夹在二根长黑棒的实体中，形成像是夹心饼的状况。<br/><br/><br/><font color=' red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表股价反弹失败后的再次下杀，这种走势可能让套牢的卖压更为沈重，可以考虑向下做空。 <br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 需留意特定筹码状况，股价下跌的过程中，是否有特定卖盘回补放空。</font>";

"看跌吞没" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 连续三天红K，隔日接续开高后，出现大跌走势，而且收盘价一次跌破前三日低点，形成一根黑K棒吃掉三天红K棒的吞噬状况。<br/><br/><br/><font color ='red'> <strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 代表空方反扑成功，后续走势将可能开始转弱。黑K棒的量能如果相对较大，将在此形成压力点，后续股价不容易越过此价位。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/>后续股价反弹如果带量越过此价位，则又翻多。</font>";

"空方孤岛" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在上涨趋势中，空方缺口接续多方缺口出现，让K线形态形成一个类似孤岛的形状。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 缺口的形成通常是因为前一天收盘后有重大消息，或是有特定大型买家或卖家介入，造成隔天股价开盘跳空不连续的状况。多方缺口为今天的最低价高于前一天最高价；空方缺口则为今天的最高价低于前一天最低价的状况。先跳多，再跳空，这样的形态通常是一个强势扭转趋势的变盘状况，空方信号强烈，应该考虑将手上持股卖出或放空。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 出现这样的形态通常暗示为一个强烈转折的空方信号，股价将开始起跌转弱，只要弹升不补缺口，都应该站在卖方。</font>";

"横盘下杀" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 股价经过一段时间的横向整理后，出现下跌而且破低的长黑K棒走势。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/>代表过去整理区间的支撑性已被破坏，将引发一连串的停损卖压涌出，使得支撑线转变成压力线。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 股价一旦成为波段的起跌点，空头走势恐将一发不可收拾。</font>";

"上影摸頭" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 上涨趋势中，股价开盘持续出现强势上攻的态势，而且盘中更创下近日的最高价，可惜收盘反转向下，留下一条长上影线。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 这线型可视为利多出尽的表现，后续股价将可能反转，形成多头获利了结的拉回走势。在上升趋势中，如果隔天又是一个长上影线，就形成类似双T倒反的形态，头部信号更加明确。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 下跌过程中，如果量能无法出现滞息量或关键的多方转折形态，股价下跌的趋势将不容易改变。</font>";


"下跌三颗星" = "<font size='5'><font color='red'><strong>定义:</strong></font><br/> 在一根长黑K重挫后，连续三日都出现小涨小跌的整理走势，但每日的高点都没有越过黑K中线位置。<br/><br/><br/><font color='red'><strong>意涵:</strong></font><br/> 这可视为在一段跌势中的中继震荡形态，股价将随时可能再度出现重挫。<br/><br/><br/><font color= 'red'><strong>注意:</strong></font><br/> 整理过程中如果出现量缩的状况将表示买卖盘变化不大，继续下跌的压力将大。</font>" ;

"Big Bull_6​​" = "Definition:\nThe candle has a large green body. The price goes up after the market Opens, and closes much higher than it opened. You can define your own size in DIY Pattern.\n\n\nImplication :\nThe intraday buying power is much stronger than the selling power. If Open is lower than yesterday's Close, Big Bull indicates the price is acceptable to many at this level. If Open is higher than the previous Close, Big Bull indicates a strong buy . If Big Bull is in a long downtrend with high volume, it might be the beginning of a bottom. This would be considered a good time to buy.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf Big Bull is in a long uptrend with decreasing volume, it might be a sign of topping. Watch out for subsequent development. You might want to sell or even to short.";

"Three Bulls_6" = "Definition:\nThree consecutive green candles, with each High higher than the previous High, and Low also higher than the previous Low.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often a strong attack signal from the buy side in the uptrend. If it happens after a long flat-trend, it is a good sign to buy. If it happens after a long downtrend, the buying signal is even stronger, and could be a bottoming sign. If it happens after a Morning Star, there a high probability that a bottom has formed.\n\n\nReminder:\nSee if the volume goes up as well. Watch out for small cap or light traffic stocks, they could be manipulated. If the three bulls have already pushed the price too high, then there may not be margin left. If three bulls happen af​​ter a long uptrend, it may be the last run, watch for subsequent development.";

"Long Horns_6" = "Definition:\nTwo consecutive days having long lower shadows, Close at or near High and higher than Open, and today's Close is higher than yesterday's Close. It is like two horns pointing down ready to hook.\n\ n\nImplication:\nA long lower shadow means Close is much higher than Low. A Long Horn or Hammer means the price was driven down during the day to a Low, but brought back up much higher, and Close at High. Two long horns with one bigger than the other indicate a strong support at this price level. If it happens in a long downtrend with high volume, it could be a strong sign of bottoming.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch the intraday volume. If the volume increases when the price goes up, then it is a strong buy. If the volume appears at Low then it is not a sharp horn.";

"Morning Star_6" = "Definition:\nIn the downtrend the price was driven down further by a red candle, followed by a gap down and ended with a cross, but then jumps back up high with a long green candle. The green candle's Close is higher than the red candle's Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nA cross happens when someone sells it to a Low and others buy it to a High but Close at O​​pen. It means the market is active but unsure which way to go . The movement of the next day often provides the clue for the direction. Morning Star appears in a downtrend. If the downtrend is persistent, it is often a good sign of bottoming.\n\n\nReminder:\nMorning Star does not happen often. When it does, it is often a good signal to buy. But do not put all your money on one sign, and watch out for fake breakthrough. You might want to increase your long position, if it is followed by Big Bull or Three Bulls.";

"Bull Hug_6" = "Definition:\nOne small red candle hugged by two green candles with larger bodies. The High and Low of the red candle are within the bodies of the green candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt happens when some buying parties try to shake the followers by faking a down turn, but are quickly pushed back up by the market. It may also happen when people are still bearish, but the buying power is strong. It often indicates the uptrend is strong.\ n\n\nReminder:\nWatch if heavy weight buyers starting to sell in the uptrend.";

"Bull & 3 Cubs_6" = "Definition:\nOne big bull beats three bear cubs. After three days of decline, it opens low again, but then rises strongly to a High, and closes higher than the High of the three red candles. \n\n\nImplication:\nThe buying power regains control and turns the trend upward, especially when the volume of the big green is about the sum of the three reds.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is not big enough, it could be just a technical bounce. That means the fundamental of the company or sentiment of the market has not changed, the bounce back is just from the falling of the price, like a deflated ball bouncing back when falling from a high place , and is most likely to fall again.";

"Long Island_6" = "Definition:\nIn the downtrend, a gap down followed by a gap up. It is like a bull island in the bear sea.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe gap is often caused by certain news after a previous session is closed, or driven by heavy weight buyers or sellers to the direction they want. A bull gap is a gap up and a green candle, with today's Low higher than yesterday's High. A bear gap is a gap down and a red candle, with today's High lower than yesterday's Low. A bear gap followed immediately by a bull gap is a strong reversal signal. It is often followed by at least a brief uptrend. As long as the price does not go back below the bull gap, you can consider staying on the buy side.\n\n\nReminder:\nThough unlikely, if the price drops back below the bull gap, it may be time to sell.";

"Breakthrough_6" = "Definition:\nA big bull appears after a long flat-trend.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the selling pressure has been digested. It may be the beginning of a bullish run. It is time to consider long position.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch subsequent development carefully, it may be a fake breakthrough with just one big bull.

"Long Shadow Bottom_6" = "Definition:\nA long lower shadow in the downtrend, opens lower than yesterday's Close, and the price keeps going down to the lowest Low on the current downtrend, but the price goes up sharply and Close at or near Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt could be followed by a technical bounce with just one long lower-shadow. If it is followed by another long lower shadow and forms long horns, then it becomes a strong sign of a bottom. \n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is not substantiated, the bounce will be limited.";

"Bull Brewing_6" = "Definition:\nA big bull follows by three small rises or falls, but none of the three days Low falls below the mid point of the big bull\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the resting of the buy side, but the bull may be ready to attack again. If the volume reduced during the three days rest, the following attack may be stronger.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there are high volumes in the three days, then the direction is not as certain.";

"Cub Stand Up_6" = "Definition:\nA gap up in the uptrend, opens with a gap up but Closes lower than it opened, and the body of the red candle is smaller than the bodies of the previous two green candles. It is like a small cub stands up to fight.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt is too weak to be a reversal sign. It often happens when some buyers are taking profit. If the volume is low, the cub can not reverse the trend , and the uptrend continues.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is high, even though the price change is small, and there are many buyers profit taking at this level, then the uptrend may not hold.";

"Bull Escape_6" = "Definition:\nA large red candle hit a recent low in a downtrend, but followed by two green candles, one smaller than the other. The larger green candle tops the large red candle with its Close higher than the High of the red candle.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the downward pressure has been stopped, and the buy side has the upper hand. The stopping sign is valid if the volume is high. If the volume is very high it could be a reversal sign.\n\n\nReminder:\nIt may not be a solid sign if the volume is smaller than the red.";

"Big Bear_6" = "Definition:\nThe candle has a large red body. The price goes down after opening, and Closes much lower than it opened. You can define your own size in DIY Pattern.\n\n\nImplication:\ nThe intraday selling power is much stronger than the buying power. If Open is higher than yesterday's Close, Big Bear indicates the buy side has started profit taking or losing confidence. If Open is lower than yesterday's Close, Big Bear indicates a strong sell. If Big Bear happens in a long uptrend with high volume, it might be a top forming. It could be a good time to sell, or time to short.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf Big Bear happens in a long downtrend with reduced volume, it might be the sign of a bottom. Watch out for subsequent development. You might want to establish a long position.";

"Three Bears_6" = "Definition:\nThree consecutive red candles, with each Low lower than the previous Low, and High also lower than the previous High.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often a strong attack signal from the sell side in the downtrend. If it happens after a long flat-trend, it is a good sign to sell. If it happens after a long uptrend, the selling signal is even stronger, and could be a top sign. If it happens after an Evening Star, it often confirms a top has formed.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch out for technical bounce. That means the fundamental of the company or sentiment of the market has not changed, the bounce back is just from the falling of the price, like a deflated ball bouncing back when falling from a high place, and is most likely to fall again.";

"Bear Teeth_6" = "Definition:\nTwo consecutive days having long upper shadows, Close at or near Low and lower than Open, and today's Close is lower than the yesterday's Close. It is like a bear roaring with two teeth pointing up.\ n\n\nImplication:\nA long upper shadow means Close is much lower than High. A Tooth or Inverted Hammer means the price was driven up during the day to a High, but brought back down much lower, and Closed at Low. Two teeth with one bigger than the other Indicates a strong selling pressure at this price level. If it happens in a long uptrend and comes with high volume, it could be a strong sign of topping.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there is a technical bounce in the subsequent development, but the bounce fails to reach the High of the teeth, then it could be a confirmation of a top.";

"Evening Star_6" = "Definition:\nIn the uptrend the price was driven up further by a green candle, followed by a gap up ended with a cross, but then jumped back down low with a long red candle, and the red candle's Close is lower than the green candle's Open .\n\n\nImplication:\nA cross happens when someone sells it to a Low and others buy it to a High but Close at O​​pen. It means the market is active but unsure which way to go . The movement of the next day often provides the clue for the direction. Evening Star appears in an uptrend. If the uptrend is persistent, it is often a good sign of topping.\n\n\nReminder:\nEvening Star does not happen often. When it does, it is often a good sign to sell. But if you want to short, it is better to look for more confirmations like Big Bear or Three Bears in the following development. Do not put all your money on one sign .";

"Bear Hug_6" = "Definition:\nOne small green candle hugged by two red candles with larger bodies. The High and Low of the green candle are within the bodies of the red candles.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt often happens when buy side tries to rebound but fails, and results in a heavier sell.

"Bear & 3 Calves_6" = "Definition:\nOne big bear engulfs three calves. After three days' ups, it opens high again, but then falls sharply to a Low, and closes lower than the Low of the three green candles.\ n\n\nImplication:\nThe selling power regains control and turns the trend downward, especially when the volume of the big red is about the sum of the three greens. The subsequent rebound is hard to overcome the High of this bear, if the volume of the bear is really large.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf subsequent rebound overcomes the High with volume, then the buy side takes control again.";

"Bear Island_6" = "Definition:\nIn the uptrend, a gap up is followed by a gap down. It is like a bear island in the bull sea.\n\n\nImplication:\nThe gap is often caused by certain news after a previous session is closed, or driven by heavy weight buyers or sellers to the direction they want. A bull gap is a gap up and a green candle, with today's Low higher than yesterday's High. A bear gap is a gap down and a red candle, with today's High lower than yesterday's Low. A bull gap followed immediately by a bear gap is a strong reversal signal. It is often followed by a downtrend. As long as the price does not go back above the bear gap, you can consider staying on the sell side or shorting.\n\n\nReminder:\nThough unlikely, if the price pulls back up the bear gap, it may be time to buy.";

"Tumble Down_6" = "Definition:\nA big bear appears after a long flat-trend.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the buying power has lost steam. It may be the beginning of a bearish run. It may be time to sell or consider shorting.\n\n\nReminder:\nWatch subsequent developments carefully, it may be a fake tumble down with just one big bear.";

"Long Spike Top_6" = "Definition:\nA long upper shadow in the uptrend, Open higher than yesterday's Close, and the price keeps going up to the highest High on the current uptrend, but the price goes down sharply and Close at or near Open.\n\n\nImplication:\nThis is often the case when the buy side runs out of stream or ready to take profit. If it is followed by another long up shadow and forms a Bear Teeth, then it becomes a strong sign of a top.\n\n\nReminder:\nIn the downtrend, to reverse the trend, the volume often has to reduce to a very small amount. So, once the trend turns here and there's bounce back, look at the volume. ";

"Bear Brewing_6" = "Definition:\nA big bear followed by three small rises or falls, but none of the three days' High went above the mid point of the big bear.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the resting of the sell side, but the bear may be ready to attack again. If the volume reduces during the three days rest, the following attack may be stronger.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf there are high volumes in the three days, then the direction is not as certain.";

"Calf Stand Up_6" = "Definition:\nA gap down in the downtrend, opens with a gap down but closes higher than it opened, and the body of the green candle is smaller than the bodies of the previous two red candles. It is like a small calf stands up to fight.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt is too weak to be a reversal sign. Do not become a big buyer immediately. If the volume is low, the calf can not reverse the trend, and the downtrend continues.\n\n\nReminder:\nIf the volume is high watch out for a bounce. If the volume is very high, even though the price change is small, and the buyers become active, the downtrend may not hold. In this case watch out for small cap manipulation.";

"Bear Invade_6" = "Definition:\nA large green candle hit a recent high in an uptrend, but followed by two red candles, one smaller than the other, the larger red candle enters the railing of the bulls, with its Close lower than the Low of the green candle.\n\n\nImplication:\nIt indicates the price may start to crumble, and the sell side has the upper hand. If the volume is very high it could be a reversal sign and a top is shaped .\n\n\nReminder:\nIt is not a solid sign if the volume is smaller than the green candle. If it bounces back later but the High does not reach the High of the green candle, it may fall back down harder. ";
